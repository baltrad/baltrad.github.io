Hardware requirements</h1>
<p >You probably already have a supplier of computer hardware, and your organization may have its opinions about what kinds of machines they want to manage in the computer hall and on the desktop. We don't interfere with this, but instead try to work on whatever is available. And this will be different in different places. A researcher might want to demonstrate the system on a notebook computer at a conference; this is no problem. Others may prefer desktop computers, tower models, rack servers, blades, and even virtual computers on shared hardware. These are all fine. We haven't yet deployed our system on industrial hardware like a single-board hardware configuration, but we doubt there are any problems here either. In the end, it's up to you to decide and get what works best for your purposes.</p>
<p >However, hardware performance will be an issue depending on how much data you plan on exchanging and processing with your node. With this in mind, here are some general guidelines. Keep in mind that these are not hard requirements, but based on what we are confident will work. In almost every case, requirements are modest.  
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Use</th> <th>CPU</th> <th>RAM</th> <th>Disk</th></tr>
<tr><td>Exchange: 20 radars</td> <td>one dual- or quad-core, >2 GHz</td>
<td>4-6 Gb</td> <td>50 Gb</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exchange: 175 radars</td> <td>1-2 dual- or quad-core, >2 GHz</td>
<td>6-8 Gb</td> <td>100 Gb</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exchange & processing: 20 radars</td> <td>one quad-core, >2.5 GHz</td>
<td>8-10 Gb</td> <td>200 Gb</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exchange & processing: 175 radars</td> <td>1-2 quad-core,
>2.5 GHz</td> <td>10-12 Gb</td> <td>>500 Gb</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p >For high-resilience solutions, at least duplicated hardware is recommended. Disks should be RAIDed, and using a Storage Area Network (SAN) is a good way for multiple hardware instances to share disk space. We do not recommend you install and use our software over networked file systems like NFS because they have a tendency to cause significant performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p >Note that disk-space estimates in the table above assume no archive because BALTRAD doesn't do archiving.</p>
<p >In all cases, an Ethernet adapter is required. For a more resilient solution, redundant adapters are recommended. See the next section for more detail on network requirements. Using BALTRAD over a WiFi connection is not recommended.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="req_nw"></a>
Network requirements</h1>
<p >BALTRAD uses TCP/IP-based networks.</p>
<p >Network bandwidth needs are notoriously difficult to determine because they depends on factors that we have difficulty quantifying. You can estimate the total amount of data by multiplying the following terms: </p><ul>
<li>Bins per ray </li>
<li>Rays per scan </li>
<li>Variables per scan, e.g. DBZH, VRAD, WRAD, etc. </li>
<li>Bytes per bin, e.g. 1 (uint8), 2 (short), 4 (float), or 8 (double) </li>
<li>Scans per volume or acquisition period </li>
<li>Radars in the network</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, you can then pad your estimate with a guess of how much metadata the ODIM_H5 files will contain, but this is negligable compared to the amount of data. File overhead caused by metadata can be minimized be using HDF5's file-creation properties intelligently, and this is what the BALTRAD code base does.</p>
<p >The number that this arithmetic exercise gives you will be the total number of bytes per acquisition period, e.g. every 5, 10, or 15 minutes. Multiply by time to get hourly, daily, and longer estimates.</p>
<p >ODIM_H5 uses default ZLIB compression in HDF5, and this compression is both efficient and lossless. However, like most other compression algorithms, ZLIB's efficiency will depend on the characteristics of the data. Lots of echoes will give relatively larger files. Dry days will be more efficiently compressed than wet ones. But on the whole, compressed files with optimized file-creation properties can be easily 10-20% the size of uncompressed files. Generally speaking, this will make them easier to transmit through the network because they will consume less bandwidth.</p>
<p >A very easy and efficient way of reducing bandwidth bottlenecks in data exchange is to transmit radar data scanwise, ie. one scan at a time. Doing this only makes sense if the radar can send you the data scanwise. There's little point in deconstructing a polar volume if that's the only thing the radar sends you. But if the radar can send you a scan while it proceeds to collect the next one, then that saved you time, and the network load is more balanced compared to transmitting a complete volume all at once.</p>
<p >Internet bandwidth is pretty inexpensive these days, whereas dedicated network bandwidth can be costly (e.g. the RMDCN in Europe). We have no hard requirements, only experience. A 64 kbit/s network connection will probably be sufficient to support the exchange of data from a few radars, whereas a 10 Mbit/s connection might be enough to support the continental scale. There are uncertainties in these estimates that need more time to be clarified.</p>
<p >For redundant hardware configurations, communications between node instances should use at least a Gigabit local-area network (LAN).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="req_sw"></a>
Software requirements</h1>
<p >We have developed our software for Linux, and to our knowledge BALTRAD software is running on Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise, and CentOS. Most of our packages run on Mac OS X too, although the complete suite hasn't been validated on it yet. Our software may run on proprietary flavors of UNIX, but we have conducted no development or testing on any.</p>
<p >Any credible 64-bit Linux distribution will have no difficulty accommodating BALTRAD software. One of the distributions mentioned above in <a class="el" href="faq.html#faq_os">What operating systems does the software run on?</a> will definitely work because it works for us already. The software will likely work on the 32-bit versions of the same distro, but some of the software's unit tests will fail.</p>
<p >The BALTRAD installation notes that accompany the software packages contain complete details on requirements. They are usually found in a text file called INSTALL.</p>
<p >A critical software requirement when using the system in real time is access to a Postgres database server version 8.3.9 or higher, preferably 8.4+. This database server does not need to be installed on the same server as the software is installed on, but it must be accessible. This requirement is not needed if you are not going to exchange any data but instead just process data off line.</p>
<p >Other required software can be managed with your distro's preferred package manager, e.g. RPM, yum, apt-get, etc.</p>
<p >If you are using the baltrad yum repository, the dependencies will be defined in the rpms so there will be indiciations on which dependencies are missing. Otherwise, if using the node installer, the following requirements are a minimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>An installed Java SDK, currently OpenJDK or SUN JDK (&gt; 1.6) </li>
<li>gcc/g++/gcc-c++ (version 4.1 or higher) </li>
<li>Gnu make (version 3.8 or higher) </li>
<li>autoconf (version 2.59 or higher) </li>
<li>Unicode support (ICU) </li>
<li>bzip2 development libraries </li>
<li>Postgres development libraries </li>
<li>Doxygen</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also need to install additional packages since one or more modules depend on them: </p><ul>
<li>PNG development libraries (used by e.g. bRopo)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you install 64-bit versions of these packages where they exist.</p>
<p >In choosing programming languages, we let ourselves be inspired by Google, who use three of them. The ones we have chosen are C/C++, <a href="http://java.com/" target="_blank">Java</a>, and <a href="http://python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. The amount of C++ code has dropped recently after we migrated one of our core subsystems to Python and Java, so C++ is no longer part of the core system.</p>
<p >We also use some other other scripting tools for specific purposes. For example, <a href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy scripting</a> (based on Java) is used for prototyping well-defined tasks. Groovy was previously hosted on Codehaus but has now moved to above link. You can find some historic information about this <a href="https://projectmanagernews.com/general/most-important-projects-codehaus/" target="_blank">here. </a></p>
